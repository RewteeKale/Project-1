                <h2>Indian monastic and philosopher</h2>
                <p>Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta (name shortened to Narendra or Naren)[18] in a Bengali
                    family in his ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta, the capital of
                    British India, on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival. He belonged to a
                    traditional family and was one of nine siblings.His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney
                    at the Calcutta High Court. Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and
                    Persian scholar who left his family and became a monk at age twenty-five. His mother,
                    Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife. The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra's
                    father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking and
                    personality. Narendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and used to
                    meditate before the images of deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman.He was
                    fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks. Narendra was mischievous and restless as a child,
                    and his parents often had difficulty controlling him. His mother said, "I prayed to Shiva for a son
                    and he has sent me one of his demons".</p>
